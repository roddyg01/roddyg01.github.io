        <p>Bought cyberoddy.com yesterday. Set up GitHub Pages today. Somewhere in between, I learned what A records actually do and why the @ symbol isn't just for email addresses.</p>

        <p>Here's what nobody tells you when you're setting up a custom domain for the first time.</p>

        <h2>The @ Symbol Mystery</h2>

        <p>First confusion: what the heck is @ in DNS settings? Turns out it's shorthand for your root domain. When you put @ as the host, you're saying "this rule applies to cyberoddy.com itself, not www.cyberoddy.com or blog.cyberoddy.com."</p>

        <p>So these A records:</p>

        <pre><code>Type: A
Host: @
Value: 185.199.108.153</code></pre>

        <p>Mean: "When someone types cyberoddy.com, send them to this IP address." That's it. The @ is just DNS notation for "the naked domain."</p>

        <h2>A Records vs CNAME Records</h2>

        <p>A records map domains to IP addresses. Simple. You're telling DNS "here's the actual server location."</p>

        <p>CNAME records are aliases. Instead of pointing to an IP, they point to another domain name. My setup:</p>

        <pre><code>Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: roddyg01.github.io</code></pre>

        <p>Translation: "When someone types www.cyberoddy.com, redirect them to roddyg01.github.io, and let GitHub handle it from there."</p>

        <p>You can't use a CNAME for the root domain (@) -- that's why you need A records pointing to GitHub's IPs for the naked domain, then a CNAME for the www subdomain.</p>

        <h2>Why Four A Records?</h2>

        <p>GitHub gives you four IP addresses:</p>

        <pre><code>185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153</code></pre>

        <p>It's redundancy. If one server goes down, the others handle traffic. You add all four as separate A records with the same host (@). DNS will route to whichever one responds fastest.</p>

        <h2>The TXT Record for Verification</h2>

        <p>GitHub makes you add a TXT record to verify you actually own the domain. It looks like this:</p>

        <pre><code>Type: TXT
Host: _github-pages-challenge-roddyg01
Value: [some long hash]</code></pre>

        <p>This is just proof of ownership. GitHub checks if you can add records to the domain's DNS. Once verified, you can delete it -- though leaving it doesn't hurt.</p>

        <h2>DNS Propagation Is a Waiting Game</h2>

        <p>Changed your DNS records? Cool. Now wait. Propagation takes anywhere from 15 minutes to 48 hours, but usually under an hour.</p>

        <p>You can check propagation with <code>dig yourdomain.com</code> or online tools like whatsmydns.net. If it's not working immediately, that's normal. Go touch grass, come back later.</p>

        <h2>SSL/HTTPS Is Automatic (Don't Pay for It)</h2>

        <p>GitHub Pages gives you free SSL through Let's Encrypt. Once your domain propagates, go to repo Settings → Pages → check "Enforce HTTPS." Done.</p>

        <p>Your registrar will try to upsell you on SSL certificates. Ignore it. You don't need it for GitHub Pages.</p>

        <h2>What I Wish I Knew Before Starting</h2>

        <p>Documentation assumes you already know what DNS does. No tutorial explained that @ is just shorthand, or why you need both A records and a CNAME, or that four A records isn't a typo.</p>

        <p>The actual setup takes 10 minutes. Figuring out what the setup actually means took three hours and a lot of tab switching between Stack Overflow and GitHub docs.</p>

        <p>Now it's written down. Next time I do this, or you do this, it'll take 10 minutes total.</p>
